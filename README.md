# Weather-data-using-python

Extracting weather data using python.

I used Openweathermap to extract weather information.
Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_in
Create an account in the website and get your personal API_KEY.
You need to paste your API_KEY in the code within the quotations.

You may hardcode your loaction if you want to!!

Location format: city_name,country_code
To make it more precise put the city's name, comma, 2-letter country code (ISO3166). You will get all proper cities in chosen country.
The order is important - the first is city name then comma then country. Example - London, GB or New York, US.
