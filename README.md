# Weather-data-using-python

Extracting weather data using python.

I have used Openweathermap to scrape accurate weather information. <br />

You can find your personal **API_KEY** in there.<br />
You need to paste your **API_KEY** in the code _within the quotations_.

You may hardcode your loaction if you want to!!

Location format: **city_name,country_code**

To make it more precise put your city's name, comma, 2-letter country code (ISO3166). You will get all proper cities in the chosen country.<br />
The order is important - **first city name then comma then country**.<br />
Example - **__London, GB__** or **_New York, US__**.

Run the following command to install the required python package:
```
pip3 install urllib3
```
